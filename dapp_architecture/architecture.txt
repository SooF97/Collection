1- DAPP Architecture:
    - the dapp will have:
        + Navbar (Home, About, Roadmap, Team, Mint)
        + Hero: 
            -- a title animated displaying a paragraph that attracts people
            -- a second little paragraph describing the collection briefly
            -- a CTA button (mint button)

2- Navbar menu:
    - Home => redirect to the home page
    - About => tell customers about the project, goals, future, benefits for holders...etc
    - Roadmap => a roadmap for the whole project
    - Team => a section about team members with their socials 
    - Mint => a minting button that allows users to redirect to the minting page
